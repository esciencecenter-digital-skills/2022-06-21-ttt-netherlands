## 🧠 Collaborative Notes & 🔧 Exercises

## Exercise: Q&A

In pairs, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures described on this page:
[https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html ](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html)

Make notes in the Collaborative Document:

What points do you think it is most important or helpful for people to remember?

- For step 1: if you've made a contribution to the lessons/glossary, you still have to email The Carpentries to have your contribution counted towards your cerfitication :scroll:. + Your contribution does not need to have been accepted for your certification to go ahead. +1
- For step 2: Make sure to put 'checkout' in your name, and verify after the meeting that your attendance has been recorded.
- For step 3: you need to prepare a full lesson (not a single episode). +1
- Step 1: keep it simpe, start with simple issues/tasks
- Step 1: tools like Github should not be a barrier for people to collaborate
- Step 1: To know where to go to interact with the lesson developers
- 
- Step 1 contribution can be an issue (does not have to be a PR)
- Step 2: sign up for community discussion etherpad
- Step 2: check timezone

What questions or points of confusion do you have, or think others might have? 

- Step 1: What exactly is the difference between the core lessons and the Carpentries Incubator?
- Step 1: under the [Eligible Repositories](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html#eligible-repositories) heading, a few repositories are recommended. Is it also okay to make a contribution to a *different* repository, as long as they're managed by The Carpentries?
- Step 1: When commenting on or opening an issue, do you need to mention you're commenting as part of your certification process?
- Step 2: Forget to put checkout in your name and thus join the discussion but don't get credit for joining it.

- Step 3: What is the actual material that needs to be prepared / one or multiple episode

- Step 1: What is the difference between issue and PR? It seems as a contribution the page is encouraging to make an issue. But there is less explaination on PR.
- Step2: Etherpads and Codimd, why using both?
- Step 3: Should slides be prepared? (Not for the live coding bit, but for intro etc)
- Step 3: when will you know what episode to teach?


## Exercise: Schedule a Discussion session (5 min)

Visit the discussion Etherpad to sign up for a session: https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions If the session you would like to attend is full, contact the discussion host and co-host to ask if you can attend.

If you would prefer to do your teaching demonstration before your discussion, visit the demo Etherpad and sign up there: https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos There is a demo rubric (linked from Collaborative Document) provided as a guide for Trainers evaluating potential new Instructors during the teaching demonstration.

## Exercise: Get connected (5 min)

Take a couple of minutes to sign up for The Carpentries channels you want to stay involved with on this page: https://carpentries.org/connect/

When you are done, share a channel you find interesting or useful on the Collaborative Document.

## Exercise (5 min) Up and Down

List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from both a learner’s and an instructor’s point of view in the Collaborative Document.
- Down: I type like a grandma when people are watching :laughing: :+1:
- Down: people may not like your keyboard sound :keyboard: so better not to use mechanical keyboard
- Down: people have different environments and will run into different errors
- Up: it is as close as possible to programming in real life
- Up: It keeps participants active and awake
- Down: It can be messy if the instructor makes mistakes
- Up: show what is difficult to explain in words
- Up: Interactive, practical, participants can learn while doing;
- up/down: prone to making mistakes, however, learners may learn from that + realise that it's normal
- Down: Can be less structural than slides; Fragile because of setup denpendencies
- Up: Participants learn immediately and get a feel for programmer ("Fingerspitzengefühl" in good German)
- Up: It keeps you as an instructor close to the material
- Down: as an instructor, you really have to be focused at all times and you need to know your story by heart for the entire lesson
- Down: Depending on how /to what extent the instructor introduces new topics, learners may get confused about what's going on, because they don't have a reference point.
- up: learning from interactive practice
- down: slides is better for theory part
- down: mistakes can be distractive
- up: Keeps learners motivated as they are interactive
- up: Forces instructor to go at a slower pace
- Down: Change your preferred IDE for something that is best for novices
- up: People see you are also make mistakes and that things can go wrong
- down: perhaps a bit difficult to keep control over the situation if some things go side ways 
- up: Realistic environment, correct speed for participants to also type in
- down: problems can occur, which can slow down the workshop; if structure is not well conveyed it can be difficult to keep an overview of the big picture.

- up: Interactive, good to learn skills
- down - hard to convey theoretical underpinning
- up: it forces learners (and instructors) not to skip over steps
- down: hard to look back to earlier steps to refresh your memory
- up: it lowers the barrier for learners to get started again after the workshop
- up: learners learn by practicing directly
- down: hard to keep everybody going at the same pace
- down: getting lost in details / losing overview
- Up: lowers the perceived barrier to starting to code.
- down: it's hard for latecomers to follow though there should not be latecomers


## Exercise: Compare & Contrast 

Watch two participatory live coding demo videos as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Collaborative Document. Use the 2x2 rubric for feedback we discussed earlier.

In the videos, the bash shell for loop is taught, and it is assumed learners are familiar with how to use a variable, the head command and the content of the basilisk.dat and unicorn.dat files.

## Exercise (3 min): Imagine a Learner

Take a moment to silently imagine a learner who might attend your workshop. 
What is their background?
What problem do they face? 
What will they gain from attending your workshop?


- : A PhD student who just started has some data and software skills fom their masters, but who is going to work in a larger project and realizes version control is a good idea.
- 
    - The participant is a PhD Candidate or Master student or researcher who doesn't know much yet about programming / using computational methods. Backgrounds can vary: one assumes they are novices;
    - They don't know what they can use coding for and how it may help them, or they know about e.g. R but haven't started learning yet
    - Basic skills with e.g. R, but also version control and shell commands
    - Challenge *after* the workshop: to keep it up (i.e. not forgetting what they've learned) and keep learning if they want to be able to do more
- :
    - The participant is a PhD student in the social sciences domain
    - They know how to use R to do data analysis
    - They don't know how to track their code in git
    - They have limited experience on collaborating on code
    - They use filenames to track different versions of files
- : PhD student doing a lot of microscopy, as a result has a lot of data / images. Currently requires a lot of manual repetitive tasks to analyze all the data, and would like to automate part of this. All required building blocks to increase efficiency in their data analysis, and understands the basics to a point where they will be able to solve (basic) problems on their own.
- : 
    - PhD candidate
    - wants to learn about reproducible workflows
    - they will know how to start using tools like git and R
- : a researcher of domain science, who knows how to perform some data skills in a laguange (e.g. MATLAB), seeking an equivelant in another (e.g. R or Python) 
-  W: staff, and/or (PhD) students at our institution. Mostly physics background. No structured organization of programming process.
- A PhD student with some basic experience in python, that wants to learn more to be able to process their specific data. They want to learn best practices and efficient ways of handling data.
- A social science PhD student who has been relying on commercial software for data analysis so far but wants to move to Python or R as their scientific toolkit; she/he is overwhelmed by the amount of new terminology etc.
- : Ecologist with little or no real coding experience. They are analysing data in their field, possibly "manually" in excel etc, but would like to automate it and use better practices (more open, sharable, reproducible research). They don't know even where to start.
- : Data carpentry with Python for social sciences: Person working in Social Science eager to learn Python to automate analysis and to understand codes shared by co-workers.  
- :
    - social science researchers (PhD students) with statstics background
    - they know little about machine learning and scikit-learn
    - they will learn the basics of ML, and how to use scikit-learn to train regression models
- PhD/staff with diverse backgrounds who want to develop their computational skills
- PhD or materstudent intersted in using computational methods in their project
al 

- : Ph.D. student, really needs to successfully complete the course to do some serious data analysis. Under a lot of pressure, behind schedule in completing research, close to burnout.
: both alpha and beta background of researchers and research support staffs. Communication can be an issue at the beginning.   

- : starting PhD student, familiar with writing texts, informal version control practices. Problems: "have to" change habits; have to learn to do things from a shell; ...


## Exercise (5 min): Where are your Checkpoints?

Have a look at your learning objective again and identify where in the lesson that objective should reasonably be achieved.


## Exercise: demos rubric (10 minutes)

Read the rubric that is given to Instructor Trainers for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions (Note: demos are not scored, so this rubric is for advisory purposes only): https://data-lessons.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/.  What questions do you have?

## Exercise: more live coding (35 minutes)

This exercise should take about 25 minutes for teaching, and 10 minutes for de-brief.

## Exercise: What are the challenges? (5 minutes)

What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching learners with a broad range of expertise? Add your thoughts in the HackMD. 

## Exercise: Know your resources (5 minutes)

1) Take 5 minutes to read through the Code of Conduct Incident Response Guidelines: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html
2) Discuss what you have read in small groups. As questions arise, you may wish to refer to our complete Code of Conduct section in The Carpentries Handbook: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html or to the Transparency Reports released by The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee: https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports

    What kinds of things could your instructional team agree upon in advance of your workshop?
    What questions do you have about CoC enforcement?

3) Write some notes in the HackMD.

This discussion should take about 10 minutes.

## Exercise: Planning together (10 minutes)

With a partner, imagine that you are planning a workshop together. For this exercise, you may assume that your workshop has a separate, designated Host.

- How would you prepare to teach a workshop together?
- How would you coordinate with other members of your instructional team (e.g. Host, Helpers)?
- What kinds of things will you do to support each other during the workshop? What won’t you do?

Record some notes, and share your thoughts with the group. This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

## Exercise - What is an introduction?  (5 minutes)!

With your neighbour, discuss:
What do you hope to accomplish in a workshop introduction?
What information do you need to include in an introduction to accomplish these goals?

## Exercise = - practice your introduction () 15 minutes

Practice your introduction (15 minutes)!

Write out some notes, covering a few of the topics described above 
Introduce yourself effectively
Clarify learning objectives and expectations
Set the tone for the workshop
Return to your groups of 2 or 3 and each give about 90 seconds of your introduction. (5-6 min)

After each introduction, briefly share feedback, reserving extensive discussion for after all have had a turn to present.

## Exercise – making the last moments count! (5 minutes)
What could you do at the end of a workshop? What would be the value? Discuss and write down suggestions in the HackMD

- tip & top
- Summarize what we've learned in the workshop
- Ask participants to summarise what they've learnt in the workshop and/or ask them their favourite concept/new skill/technique
- Ask participants how they'll use the acquired skills/knowledge in their work
- Ask for feedback in the collaborative document
- Ask what questions participants have or answer remaining questions in the parking lot of the collaborative document
- Explain that everything they have learned can be looked again in their own time and pace, and include a few potential next steps that they could take their personal growth towards with a few example projects.
- Point to any further resources
- Post-workshop survey!
- Q & A
- general Q&A (not too detailed, more about practical applications, additional resources etc.)
- Overview of all topics addressed (recapitulation)
- Summarize the previous teaching
- Ask people to write feedbacks
- Reflect on what the learners have learned, to give them a good growth mindset!
- Recap of the day (or workshop on last day), and teaser of what will come the day after (in case there will be one) 
- Tell what is next. Can people contact you with questions, were can they get more information. 
- Do you have any outstanding questions from any of the material covered over the workshop? (the full workshop)
- getting feedback as much as possible;
- Ask how can the workshop help people's daily work
- Combine recap with drinks. So not allowed to leave yet, but people can grab a soda. So you can recap in a relaxed atmosphere.

- Using post-its for signalling you're done or in trouble (zeugma)
- Carpenntries checklists
- Feedback is hard
-  keep pace
-  shared doc 
-  preparation, practice and feedback make perfect
-  tip & top, up & down
- Use light mode of the terminal
- stimulating learner participation
- Instructor notes in the lesson material :+1:

- Error framing


Tip 
- need notes and the laptop, need to be prepared
- became unresponsive after 3pm :)
- brain dead, exercise frequency increased a lot
- did not switch around people any more
- a lot of information in two days
- seeing the big picture
- no answered yet the questions in the document
- 

Top
- practice
- refering to the things that were discussed to put them in the context
- yesterday, feeling comfortable
- calm way of delivery of the workshop
- details of setting up workshop etc
- good to go through all the practicalities and to imagine the learner, when then come to the workshop
- people from the center and outside
- sharing documents and toher thigs that can be reused

## Questions?

- How much can you 'safely' deviate from the course materials provided by the Carpentries?
    - Should we still refer to the standard course schedule if we deviate from it?
- How strict is the format/procedure/...?
- It is very helpful if participants install all necessary software (and download data) *before* the workshop. How to best encourage this behaviour? And how to deal with learners who mention casually halfway down your lesson "oh, I don't think I have this installed"?
  - some experience from teaching at the eScience Center: when sending an e-mail to the participants before the workshop, we link to the setup instructions that are part of most (all?) carpentries courses. Adding a short version of the installation instructions to the e-mail itself can be helpful. For really entry-level workshops we sometimes organize an optional setup session a few days before the workshop, where participants can get help with installation of the required software. Still, you're often run into a situation where some participants don't have everything installed, so asking about that at the start of a workshop is useful. 
  - Lieke here: Agree completely with the answer above. Recently we taught a couple of data carpentry workshops, where at the end of day 1 we took some time to make sure that everyone had their Python setup in order (those who did could leave). This worked quite well. In  general, you will always need to do a check at the beginning of a workshop, to see if everyone can open their notebooks / start the necessary software. There will almost always be participants for whom it isn't working. That requires you or your helpers to spend time dedicated to those participants, while some of the others wait. It can be quite annoying for the rest of the participants, but it means that everyone is actually on board when starting, and no one is panicking and trying to get their software to work. 
- Joining community meeting is mentioned in the instructor's checklists (both pre- and post-workshop) - what happens in these meetings? Is there any advantage in joining these meeting close to a workshop?
- it says that an increase in self-organised workshops makes it harder for the workshop administration to find instructors for centrally-organised workshops; from the box, I don't get how the use of certain channels for recruiting instructors helps with that
- Should a helper (always) be a certified instructor?
    - Formally there only needs to be one certified instructor (of the two instructors). Helpers don't need to be certified, but it is great route towards becoming an instructor. 
- Should you also involve the Carpentries when you just want to teach one lesson (rather than a complete course)?

- Is it expected that all self-organised workshops be published on the carpentries website?

- What is the relationship between eScience center and Carpentries? Are all eScience center workshop also Carpentries workshop?
- The Carpentries is about acquiring skills, not tricks. At the end of a workshop I sometimes feel I taught students a lot of tricks without enough theoretical underpinning. How do you balance that?
