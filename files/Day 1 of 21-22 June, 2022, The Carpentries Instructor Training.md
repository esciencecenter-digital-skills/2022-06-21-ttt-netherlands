## Exercise 2
Consider an analogy that you might use to explain your work/hobby
1. Share it with your group
1. Discuss how it is useful, how it is wrong

## Exercise 3

1. Draw a concept map of the topic you discussed just now (the analogy in Activity 4)
1. Identify 1 - 2 core concepts, and their relationships
1. Identify 1 (or more) types of misconception that can occur and classify them as factual error, broken model, or fundamental belief


## Exercise 5 - Formative Assessment MCQ (HackMD)

Choose one wrong answer and write in the HackMD what the misconception is associated with that wrong answer
- : C: the learner does carry the 1 over but instead of combining it with the other "tientallen" they give it a place in between
- : C - learner does not actually carry over but concatenates separate additions 
- : D - the learner does not realize that when adding 15, the one is in the tens place. They are adding one to the result instead of ten.
- : B. The learner forgot to carry over the 1 after adding 7 and 5 
- : B the student forgot to carry 1 over.
- : B - the student does not add 1 to the first digit after summing the rightmost digits
- : C: Student starts right, but does not add the decimal number to the preceding addition
- : B) when adding up 7 and 5, only the resulting 2 is added to the final result, but not the 1 to the first position of the result (carry over)
C - the learners adds the the 10s (3) and 1s (12) by putting them behind each other 
-  : B - forgot the carrier in total 
-  : C - carrier not added to higher power of ten 
C - did not correctly identify the position of decimalization

- A - Fundamental belief: Some people think it's the answer to everything.
- C - the 10 of 12 is not added to 2 and 1, but 2 and 1 are now treated as hunderds 
- : B, misundstand addtion 
D - The carried 1 (from 12) is added to the units column rather than the tens column
- : D: the student carried from the ones to the ones instead of to the tens

## Exercise 6 - Handling Outcomes

Formative assessments allow us as instructors to adapt our instruction to our audience. What should we do as instructors if the class chooses:
1. mostly one of the wrong answers?
    - Think about the misconceptions the wrong answer has revealed an try to explain why it isn't the case, use a different analogy/explanation
    - ask students the steps of calulation for error analysis and then show the right way (maybe by students); document the common errors and optimise the lesson material
    - Announce that you will explain the concepts *and* the methods to reach the right answers again, step by step. Probably choose a different analogy. If students overwhelmingly choose one specific incorrect answer, explain the misconception
    -  Identify the (general) misconception
    - Change the instruction for next time. 
    - depending on the context there are several options: find out what the problems are (ask for feedback, reformulate the question),
    - find de misconception of the wrong answer and explain why that is different from the right answer.

3. mostly the right answer?
    - Identify the misconceptions in the wrong answers and try to explain them and link them to the correct concepts and pre-existing knowledge.
    - Focus on the remaining wrong answers to help specific students 
    - reexplain why the correct answer is right, to help learners who made errors understand
    - Go on with the rest of the material
    - Check whether it was as obvious as it seems
5. an even spread among options?
    - Re-explain the topic generally (but maybe in different words, analogies etc)
    - Explain what conceptual steps are correct and which ones are wrong, and why they are correct/wrong.
    - Let the both sides present their answers and discuss them
    - Have one of the students with the right answer explain it
    - Explain what are the misconceptions behind each of the wrong answers, re-explain the correct model
    - Have the participants with the right answer explain
    - Check/discuss the invididual misconception
    - Re-check if students understood the prerequisites for this question somehow

For one of the above, enter your answer in the HackMD.


## Exercise 7

think 2 min
pair 3 min
share with the rest for the group

What is something that you are an expert in? How does your experience when you are acting as an expert differ from when you are not an expert?

## Exercise 8

- Is there anything you are learning how to do right now? Can you identify something that you still need to think about, but your teacher can do without thinking about it?
    - 3d modeling in blender. There are many different ways to get a similar result and I am sometimes overwhelmed by the different options. I don't have an intuition that I can follow. For programming there are also many different solutions but I don't get lost thinking about the different options
    - learning French: teacher is using filler words without noticing it (native); I don't know a lot of them and try to assign a meaning to individual words
    - CFD in OpenFOAM, finding the right components of a model and identifying errors.
    - Driving. Shoulder check.
    - I can do basic stuff in Python but am still learning to apply knowledge/skills more. When I ask for help, the teacher/helper can basically answer the question in 1 second.
    - learning when to use which database types
    - learning to use Machine Learning library. I am familiar with only parts of the process. Still confused about others, also because of the (missing) theoretical underpinning.
    - Sailing - casting off, right of way etc
    - House renovation - what steps to do in which order
    - web app UX design, basic priciples and commonly used tools/methods
    - Moodle (e-learning platform)- oversee the idea behind the structure of the program 
    - Repairing my bicycle. What way to turn a barrel adjuster if the bike doesn't shift well. I need to make a couple of concuious steps; an expert would know straight awau
    - tai chi - coordinating hand/leg movements, posture, etc
    - while learning diving, I would check indicators equipments multiple times, while experts would be confortable/not need too much checking.

- Think about the area of expertise you identified for yourself earlier. What could a potential awareness gap be?
    - When teaching programming be aware that e.g. certain syntax may not be familiar to the learners
    -  Scope of variables in programming; separation of concerns/designing.
    - thinking too visually might cause others to not understand because concepts are not verbalised
    -  I'm good at baking bread. But others could have trouble identifying when it (the dough or the bake) is right or might be insecure of what they're doing / how to follow the instructions (I also had quite a few epic failures when I started out).
    - For me it is a given that modularity is important while programming. First-time programmers don't necessarily realize this. Also, when you are still learning the concept of functions it does not necessarily make code more understandable to divide it up into functions.
    - For programming, avoid method chaining or concatenating too many steps which an expert can easily break down, while a novice might be impeded by the complexity of the syntax 
    - Knowing which questions to ask
    - In teaching Python, I would make the mistake of starting typing right away, while the student might not have knowledge of all these commands.
    - Assuming that students know why you would even want to do the thing you're showing them (e.g 
    - 9why would you even want to do this in python?)
    - coding in R: understand the different types of objects
    - 

## Exercise 10 – test your working memory

## Exercise 10 (again) – test your working memory

- Repeat the memory exercise you did earlier, but this time, try to form short stories or phrases, or a visual image, from the words you see.
- Write the number of words you remembered in the HackMD. How does this compare with your first attempt?
- 
https://miku.github.io/activememory/

- 7 (4 the last time :+1:)
- 6
- 8 (+1)
- 8 (7 the last time)
- 7
- 6
- 4 (5 the last time :cry: )
- 4->6

## Exercise 11: How can you affect motivation?

Think back to courses you have taken in the past and consider things that an instructor has said or done that you found either motivating or demotivating. Try to think of one example in each case, and share your example under the appropriate heading in the HackMD. 

- Motivating: "Split a problem by taking baby steps" 
- Demotivating: "Ik kreeg kromme tenen toen ik dit las"/"this made me cringe"
- Demotivating: Spending 30+ minutes to explain what a median is
- Demotivating: "The algorithm isn't very complicated, it's just this formula: `<insert enormous formula here>`"
- Motivating: "Let's test this new concept in a small game"
- Motivating: Making a mistake and showing how to solve it
- m: you're doing great!
- d: it is easy
- Motivating: follow the instrustor's live coding and code works; 
- De-motivating: find a dependency is missing and it takes long to install
- Motivating: showing the potential of a software package. 
- Demotivating: a large number of steps to be taken before you can do anything with it.
- Motivating: instructor's own commitment/involvement in course
- Motivating: This tool is very useful for a range of uses, e.g. X, Y and Z.
- Demotivating: Here is this incredibly specific use case that you can't imagine ever needing to do.
- Motivating: being encouraged to code along with the instructor and being told that this will help you to learn; 
- Demotivating: "you can find this on google" in response to a question I asked
- Motivating: see instructor making mistakes and correcting him/herself - errors are more "human"/normal 
- demotivating: falling 100 times and getting bruised is best for learning Aikido (Japanese master)
- motivating: praise progress during an exercise. Weirdly motivating: the author of the book can't remember how to solve this exercise and we don't have the solution
- demotivating: teacher focuses only on high-achieving students
- motivating: slow pace, reassuring that everyone is following
- motivating: "nobody did this exercise better than you!"
- demotivating: "I am running out of time to cover this."
- demotivating: using contrived task/example (making things seem pointless)
- Motivating: giving examples
- motivating: treating mistakes casually like they are natural things to happen
- motivating: live coding

## Exercise 12

A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they’ve made an error that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between `ls` and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?

- Mistake: assume that return and print have similar functionality because jupyter automatically prints certain output. Explanation: describe how return and print both have different functions, what happens when you use either, and describe why in the current notebook some output is printed when using return.
- the space mistake: "Let's think from a computer perspective. The computer is trying to understand which one is the command, and which one is the argument. We need to give the comupter an indication to separate them."
- a relative path points to a folder that does not exist; I would point to the path string and mark the name of the folder, asking where the path points at given the specified string
- ask the learner what they think the error message means. Then correct that as needed and guide them to what the cause of the error is, repeating the relevant part of the explanation
- **Mistake**: the learner tries to load a file with a relative filepath in python but they aren't running the code with the right working directory
    - **Explanation**: I would asses whether the participant is aware of the connection between the filepaths and how they show up in the visual file browser. Then I would focus on how the learner is running the python script and explain that the relative paths will be different based on where they are running the command for the python script
- Learner tried to load data file into Python while the file is in a different folder than it is for the instructor:
    - Explain to them the situation - where's the file in their folder(s)
    - Explain what the instructor's code means
    - Ask them how they'd amend the code to load the file in their situation
- Wrong whitespace indentations in python. Say it's not a problem, that it is a common mistake/confusion. Show them the correct way, and re-explain the concept. Finally, try a different example to see if they are grasping the concept this time. Repeat until they understand. (Also ask if they have used other languages in the past e.g. c, as this might explain the way they are thinking about the problem)
- Mistake: wrong indentation in Python; show that this is a mistake that is easily made, since you cannot see it right away. Be aware of keeping it consistent.
- The learner forgets to include the entire path to a csv file; ask where they think R is looking for the file. Is the file there?
- You are almost there.
- Missing space: lets put the command in human wording, what does it mean? this should lead to two elements, what you want to do and on what, similar to grammar. 
- explain in more detail what the student had not understood
- using wrong python enviroment. 
    - the package cannot be found is becuase it's not in current enviroment, you need to go to the "dev" enviroment
- With the error above (missing space): let them realize how the shell would interprete the code the learner typed, stress that this is common mistake for who's not used to programming.
- no worry, we try again to install the right R-package. I'll help you to solve this issue. I think you need to do this first. 
- in git, use 'git commit "Message"' instead of '-m "Message"'; go over the components of the command line one at a time

## Exercise 13

Since we are so used to being praised for our performance, it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners. Which of these examples of praise do you think are based on performance, effort, or improvement?

1. 
Improvement :dancer: :) :+1: :)

## Exercise 14

Look back at the feedback you received on your teaching. How do you feel about this feedback? Is it fair and reasonable? Do you agree with it?

Identify at least one specific change you will make to your teaching based on this feedback. Describe your change in the HackMD
- preparation and rehearsal help a lot :100: 
- do not forget introducing yourself :smiley_cat: 
- Make sure to also visually show what I am explaining using live-coding
- Don't place something between myself and the students
- Force myself to *not* say "uhm" +1 :+1: 
- Pay attention to redundant small body movements like pulling my hair +1
- Do not use acronyms, or explain them once.
- Try not to introduce too many concepts from the start; some things will follow later naturally 
- prepare and rehearse +1+1
- Spend some time preparing introduction to each episode
- Prepare well, and be positive about other tools!
- Don't visualise mentally, consider more what the audience can see/hear
- Prepare/know how to end part of an explanation
- Body language: do not turn to much to and fro.
- Again: prepare well.
- Practice to be able to estimate time something takes better
- I thought the feedback was fair and reasonable and agreed with it. +1
- I added "you know" :scream: without noticing. Although I didn't do that consciously, I'll try to never do it again.
- I also wasn't completely clear that I was talking about the GUI in the beginning (introducing the shell), I'll make that clearer next time
To be clear and concise

## Feedback:
Went well
- Good pace and teaching
- Mental models
- Getting background on teaching theory
- Good level of depth
- Atmosphere (compliment also to fellow students)
- Balance between individual exercises and group discussions
- Group assignments (not only learning from central teacher, but working together)
- Interactivity made it engaging
- Recording 90 second presentation worked well

To improve
- Switching of seats
- Teaching philosophy was difficult to change in context when not hearing about Carpentries before
- Would be useful to explain differences between formal education and Carpentries
- Jargon-y terms in teaching philosophy (formative assessment)
- Give more time for homework
- Lot of material, unsure if it will stick
- Make sure everyone can see the full screen from everywhere in the room
- Homework
